## Hi there, I'm Helen (Tram) 👋
A curious mind at the intersection of **psychology**, **cognitive science**, and **technology**. I'm passionate about building softwares that bridge tech and healthcare, making systems more human-centered and accessible. 

Lately, I’ve been diving into full-stack development and data science to bring these ideas to life. My latest project is **[StarLit](https://github.com/tramtran-helen/fullstack-starlit-app.git)** - a journaling web app that supports emotional well-being through mood tagging, AI-generated visuals, and mood analytics ✨

I'm also actively exploring deep learning, AI-powered platforms, and how they can enhance personal reflection and care accessibility.

When I'm not building, you’ll find me:
- 🎨 Painting whatever comes to mind
- 🎧 Vibing to nostalgic Vietnamese 90s music
- ✈️ Traveling, usually with a sketchbook or journal in hand
